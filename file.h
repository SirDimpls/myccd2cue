 * ### Concept ###
 *
 * In this context, a file name's _reference name_ is a name used to
 * derive another names for correlate files.  For instance, if we have
 * the file 'qux/foo.bar' a correlate file name would be 'qux/foo.baz'
 * or even 'foo.baz', where the reference names are 'qux/foo' and
 * 'foo', respectively.
 *
 * So, basically, a _reference name_ is the original name without
 * extension, if it has one, regardless if one takes its full
 * component names or only the base name.
