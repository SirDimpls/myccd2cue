 * Parse _CCD sheet_ stream into a _CCD sheet_ structure.

 *
 * This function is intended to parse a correct CCD sheet and to __not__
 * generate unpredictable or inconsistent behavior when the stream is
 * an invalid CCD sheet.  So, even if the CCD sheet is not valid it
 * will be parsed and a correct structure, not necessarily useful,
 * will be returned.  It is __not__ made an attempt to maximize the
 * information extraction from stream in the rare case of a damaged
 * CCD sheet.  So, it can be the case that this function process
 * correctly some damaged CCD sheet and return a result as if a
 * non-damaged version of the same CCD sheet were the original input,
 * but it is not guaranteed and not all possible provisions were taken
 * to handle cases like this.
 *
 * This function is complete in the sense that it recognizes and
 * parses all possible CCD sheet declarations, even those that do not
 * are used in the conversion process to a CUE sheet.  So, in
 * principle, this conversion step is reversible, i.e, it is possible
 * to reconstruct the exact input CCD sheet from the generated ccd
 * structure.
 *
 * This function only fail on an obscure case where it is impossible
 * to read some line of the input stream.

 * - Next step:
 *   + ::ccd2cue
 *   + ::ccd2cdt
