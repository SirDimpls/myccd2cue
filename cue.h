 * _FILE_ entry's file type;
 *
 * This enumeration lists the file types supported as the second
 * parameter in a _FILE_ entry.  It is supposed to identify the data
 * nature of the disc image or audio files to be written to CD when
 * the _CUE sheet_ is used to burn it.
 *
 * There are a total of 5 types: two types for raw data and three for
 * audio.  The raw data types are _BINARY_ and _MOTOROLA_, and they
 * differ only in endianness --- little and big endian respectively.
 * The audio types are AIFF, WAVE and MP3 and the correspondent files
 * must be setup to 44.1 KHz, 16 bits and stereo.
 *
 * Actually all _CCD sheets_ uses a disc image with the standard
 * ".img" extension and type _MOTOROLA_.

 * _FILE entry_ structure;
 *
 * This structure holds the information of a _FILE_ and _TRACK_
 * entries.  It is used to specify the data or audio file to be
 * written to CD when the _CUE sheet_ is used to burn it.  It also
 * specifies the tracks into which that file is split on the resultant
 * disc.
 *
 * All track numbers must be between 1 and 99 inclusive.  The first
 * track number can be greater than one, but all track numbers after
 * the first must be sequential.  Each file must have at least one
 * track.

 * _MSF time_ structure;
 *
 * This structure is used to represent time measure in a _CUE sheet_.
 * It is based on the following temporal correspondence:
 *
 *- 1 second = 75 frames
 *- 1 minute = 60 seconds
 *
 * _Seconds_ and _minutes_ holds its usual meaning and _frames_ is the
 * time length remainder less than 1 second, each unit being the 75th
 * part of a second.
 *
 * Often this structure is filled by the function ::frames2msf that
 * converts a raw frames based time to the MSF format.  It is used on
 * the ::cue_TRACK.PREGAP, ::cue_TRACK.POSTGAP and ::cue_TRACK.INDEX
 * fields of the ::cue_TRACK structure.

 * of data to the CD in the burning process.
 *
 * There are 8 different data types but not all recorders can handle
 * all of them.  It seems _CCD sheets_ only can use 3 of them: AUDIO,
 * MODE1/2352 and MODE2/2352.

 * to the beginning of the current file.  The first index number must
 * be 0 or 1 with all other indexes being sequential to the first one.
 * The first index of a track must start at 00:00:00.  INDEX 0
 * specifies the starting time of the track pre-gap.  INDEX 1
 * specifies the starting time of the track data.  Index 1 is the only
 * index that is stored in the disc's table-of-contents.  INDEX
 * numbers greater than 1 specify a subindex within a track.

/*
 * The following functions are higher level interfaces to allocation
 * and initialization of arrays of structures defined in this file.
 * They provide an uniform way of allocation and initialization that
 * latter transformation code can rely upon.  Thus, usually, it is an
 * error to allocate and initialize arrays of those structures
 * manually, as that can be a big source of hard to trace bugs.
 *
 * The function naming follow a consistent scheme: <struc_name>_init,
 * where <struc_name> is the correspondent structure name.  The
 * function prototypes are also consistent; all functions are given
 * the same array size argument and returns a pointer to the newly
 * allocated array.  Every element in the array is initialized
 * accordingly.
 *
 * On the following functions, after the allocation the initialization
 * procedure takes place. It works by assigning the canonical initial
 * values to each field.  It means that integers gets a appropriate
 * default value or zero if there is not one suitable, pointers gets a
 * _NULL pointer_ and character arrays a null character on the first
 * array position.
 *
 * The functions are often used in the ::ccd2cue function in order to
 * mark the fields of the respective structures that were not
 * originally supplied by the ::ccd structure and then consistently
 * apply posterior transformation with ::cue2stream.
 *
 * The functions only fail if there is some allocation error.  A
 * failure is always fatal, i.e., the program exits with error.
 * Therefore, all functions only return with success.
